## About The Project

This project was developed as a multi-phase portfolio piece to build a lifelong personal assistant. It began as a simple command-line tool for logging workouts and meals and evolved into an intelligent system capable of generating complete, personalized transformation plans using the Google Gemini API. The final phase wrapped the entire backend in a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
